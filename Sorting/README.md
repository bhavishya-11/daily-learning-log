# ðŸ”¢ Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains my implementations of common sorting algorithms in **C++**.  
Each algorithm has its own file with code.

## âœ… Implemented
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

## ðŸ“– Purpose
Sorting is one of the most fundamental concepts in Computer Science and is often used as a building block for more complex algorithms.
